# When the Sea Remembered

# An Interactive Reflection on False Creek’s Lost Shoreline

**Project Overview**  
When the Sea Remembered... is an interactive web application that digitally “restores” marine and coastal species that were once abundant in Vancouver's False Creek / Burrard Inlet but have since declined or disappeared due to human activities. Users can explore historical ecology, understand human impacts, and interact with AI-generated dialogues via **Gemini API**.

---

## 🌿 Project Goals
- Visualize historical vs. current ecological conditions of False Creek  
- Provide educational content about marine and coastal biodiversity  
- Use interactive animations to simulate species disappearance, habitat degradation, and potential restoration  
- Enable AI-generated dialogues using **Gemini API**, allowing users to ask questions about species or habitats  

---

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML, CSS, SVG/Canvas for interactive animations  
- **Backend / Server:** Node.js, Express  
- **AI Integration:** Gemini API for natural language responses  
- **Maps / Geolocation:** Google Maps API  
- **Data:** Historical ecology research, catch records, survey CSV/JSON  
- **Deployment:** Render
